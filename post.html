            You might be saying to yourself,
            <em
              >"obviously it is important to take your best friend out for a
              walk, who wouldn't?!"</em

            It is so beneficial for your dog in so many ways to go out for a
            walk, but also very beneficial for you as an owner. For one, you're
            walking! It helps you burn some calories and you get to explore the
            outdoors.
          </p>

            However, something so mundane as walking your dog can turn into so
            much more. We love walking our dog to discover something new in our
            neighborhood. We <strong>socialize</strong> more with these walks,
            with neighbors or new people at parks or hikes on trails.

          <p>
            As mentioned before, <strong>health benefits</strong> are a
            <em>huge</em> factor to go out, more than just walks, they help you
            lower blood pressure, decrease stress, build stronger bones and
            muscles.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is easy to simply get out of the house and walk a few feet so
            that your favorite pet simply relieve themselves and then go inside.
            But if you take on more longer of a walk, both of you will benefit
            so much more with longer walks.
