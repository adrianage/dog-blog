                        You might be saying to yourself,
                        <em>"obviously it is important to take your best friend out for a walk, who wouldn't?!"</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is so beneficial for your dog in so many ways to go out for a walk, but also very beneficial for you as an owner. For one, you're walking! It helps you burn some calories and you get to explore the outdoors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, something so mundane as walking your dog can turn into so much more. We love walking our dog to discover something new in our neighborhood. We <strong>socialize</strong> more with these walks, with neighbors
                        or new people at parks or hikes on trails.

                        <strong class="quote">"</strong>Did you know that a recent survey found that only half of dog parents walk their dog at least once a day? A whopping 33% even admitted they rarely walk their dogs!

                    <p>As mentioned before, <strong>health benefits</strong> are a <em>huge</em> factor to go out, more than just walks, they help you lower blood pressure, decrease stress, build stronger bones and muscles.</p>
                    <p>
                        It is easy to simply get out of the house and walk a few feet so that your favorite pet simply relieve themselves and then go inside. But if you take on more longer of a walk, both of you will benefit so much more
                        with longer walks.
